  "Impact": "<p>The code implements the file download to the client, but if the incoming parameters are not filtered, it can download any file of the service, resulting in any file download vulnerability. For example, downloading database configuration files can lead hackers to successfully enter the database or sensitive information of the system. Cause the website or server to fall.<br></p>",
